# Electrical design


## Overall concept

Plug-in units are interconnected with a backplane mounted on the rear horizontal rails within the subrack.
Power to the backplane is provided using bidirectional/source units from their respective front panels.
Data communication and any field connections are only done on plug-in unit front panels.
