## Plug-in unit front panels

The cceptable thickness of the front panel is 2, 2.5 and 3 mm. Width of the front panel is calculated as
``n * 20.32 - 0.30 mm``, where ``n`` represents the width of the unit in modules with each module being ``20.32 mm``
wide. For a 1-module wide plug-in unit, the nominal width is ``20.02 mm``. The height of a 3U front panel is
``128.4 mm``.

Front panels contain two holes for attaching to a PCB, they are horizontally centered to the second HP from the left.
Vertical distance of the holes is ``99.00 mm``, diameter is ``2.7 mm`` and they are vertically centered.

Near the bottom PCB holder hole, there are multiple helper holes to aid in the alignment of the front bracket/holder.
These holes are spaced ``5.08 mm`` apart, typically one hole to the left and two holes to the right of the PCB holder
hole. Please refer to the figure below for further clarification.

Front panels are secured to the subrack front rails using two ``M2.5`` screws for 1 module wide units and four
``M2.5`` for units that are 2 modules or wider. The attachment holes are horizontally centered in the second HP from
the left (and second HP from the right for 2-module and wider units). The holes are vertically centered and their
vertical distance is ``122.5 mm``.
