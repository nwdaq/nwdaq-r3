Introduction

nwDaq-R3 *platform* is based on a standard IEC 60297-3 subrack. Exact dimensions of the subrack assembly and its
components can be found in the `mechanical-design` section. It describes side panels, horizontal rails, rail
positions, possible subrack sizes and depths, backplane mounting, front panels of plug-in units and front panel
blinds, plug-in units itself, backplane connector layout, etc.

Signals on the backplane are described in the `electrical-design` section including power rail types, power classes,
redundant communication buses for both slow, low power and fast data exchange.

To be compatible on the software level, section `communication-protocols` describes protocols used on the ``nbus2``
bus, 10Base-T1S and 100Base-T1 buses. Protocol of the ``nwdaq-pbus`` used to communicate power resources is described
there too.
