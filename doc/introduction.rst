The nwDaq-R3 platform is based on a standard IEC 60297-3 subrack. For detailed information on the subrack assembly
and its components, including dimensions, please refer to the `mechanical-design` section. This section covers topics
such as side panels, horizontal rails, rail positions, subrack sizes and depths, backplane mounting, front panels and
blinds for plug-in units, plug-in units themselves, and backplane connector layouts.

The `electrical-design` section provides details on the signals on the backplane, including power rail types,
power classes, and redundant communication buses for both low-power, slow and high-speed data transfer.

To ensure software compatibility, the `communication-protocols` section outlines the protocols used on the
``nwdaq-nbus2`` bus, as well as the 10Base-T1S and 100Base-T1/1GBase-T1 buses. Additionally, this section describes
the protocol used for the ``nwdaq-pbus`` bus, which is employed for communicating power resource information.
